# Multiplication-Game
This is the result of day 2 of practicing my vanilla JS concepts. It's a simple multiplication game in which you will be asked simple multiplication questions and for each correct answer you will be rewarded +1 point and for every wrong answer a -1 . I got the idea to make this project from JavaScript King.
